# henriquepicanco's dotfiles for Linux

Here I place all my configurations for Linux programs and apps, target for Ubuntu, Fedora and Arch Linux, but also targeting Ubuntu on WSL at Windows.

I manage my Windows' dotfiles on another repository. See [dotfiles-windows](https://github.com/henriquepicanco/dotfiles-windows) for more.
